    "The purpose of this lab is to walk through steps for building a statistical model for task-evoked changes in BOLD signal. Up to now we have practiced steps involved in preprocessing via the command-line. In today's lab we'll see how to set up these steps with the GUI in FSL, and then test for task-related activation on the preprocessed image. \n",
