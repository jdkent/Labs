Creating random designs in fMRI world often leads to under powered designs because the randomisation does not consider the lagged hemodynamic response and how one trial's response may bleed into another trial's response. This is more of a concern in event related designs, but still something to consider in block designs as well.\n",

    "Take some time to think about your own experiment and how you can present your stimuli below. Follow the comments and change your parameters accordingly, some you will most likely want to change and some you will probably want to leave alone. Those parameters you will most likely wish to change will have 'CHANGE' written above them, the parameters to leave alone will have 'NO CHANGE' written above them. To learn more about the parameters you can read the [documentation](http://neurodesign.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/src/geneticalgorithm.html#experiment), and read the information on the webpage version of this program, specifically see [Tutorial]( and Methods"
