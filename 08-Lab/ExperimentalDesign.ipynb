Creating random designs (without evaluation) in fMRI world often leads to under powered designs because the randomisation does not consider the lagged hemodynamic response and how one trial's response may bleed into another trial's response. This is more of a concern in event related designs, but still something to consider in block designs as well.\n",

    "This is a measure of how correlated the regressors (e.g. con, inc, and neu) are with each other. For example, if a congruent trial always followed 2 seconds after an incongruent trial the regressors would be highly correlated resulting in a very low variance reduction factor. Each condition (e.g. congruent, incongruent, and neutral) will have their own variance reduction factor. If $i$ stands for a particular condition $i$ (which can take the value of congruent, incongruent, or neutral in this instance), and $n$ represents the number of conditions (in this case 3), then we can calculate the average variance reduction factor like so:\n",

    "Where $R_i^2$ is the r-squared component for that particular condition. In other words, $R_i^2$ measures the amount of variance in condition $i$ that can be explained by the other conditions. To give some intuition, a small variance reduction factor means the conditions are highly correlated with each other $R^2 = 0.99; 1 - R^2 = 0.01$, whereas a small variance reduction factor means the conditions are largely independent $R^2 = 0.01; 1 - R^2 = 0.99$. Unfortunately, outside of optseq, people often use variance inflation factor (VIF) when describing colinearity. Thankfully, the average variance inflation factor equation is just the inverse of the variance reduction factor equation.\n",
